# Instant Cleaner

A fast PC cleaner app "programmed" in Batch.

## Usage

To use the program, simply run **the downloaded executable** and select a mode.

## Variables

You can also select a mode using variables by opening a CMD and mentioning the mode you want to use.

- normal for Normal Mode
- fast for Fast-Mode
- exp for Experimental
- no variable for Minimal (forgot to code it for that mode yet again)

**Example:**

```Instant-Cleaner_v1.0.2-beta.exe exp```

## Modes

There are currently **four different modes** included, but only **three of them** have variables.

- Normal Mode
- Fast-mode
- Experimental
- Minimal

## Future updates

We might add the ability to create **custom modes** that clean certain files and directories.
